# Home

Welcome to Avid developer documentation. This is the place to document aspects of the platform that rise above the concerns of a single component; cross-cutting concerns, architecture, shared developer tooling, etc.

#### How to use

Other than for purposes of a platform overview, try to avoid documenting individual components here. Use a component's README and wiki pages to document the unique aspects and behaviours of each component.

### New Developers

If you are new to Avid development, you should read the overview for each section to get a sense of how the platform works and how to maximise your contribution.
